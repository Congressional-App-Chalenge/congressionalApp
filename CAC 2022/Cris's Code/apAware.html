    <p >
        An AP score of a 3 is guaranteed to get students credit 
        at about 58% of public and 33% of private colleges. Getting
        credit lets you be exempt from taking the classes in college 
        for which you took the AP tests, which means you pay less because
        you are taking fewer classes. This means taking AP exams can cut down
        the amount of time you have to spend in college, greatly decreasing
        the cost you have to spend on college. 1 college credit hour
        means an average of about $621 at 4-year institutions or $303 at 2-year
        institutions. The only question is would you like to spend a little 
        time either self-studying for the test or taking the class in highschool 
        and pay around $100 now or have crippling college debt later.

        According to research done by the College Board, students scoring a 2 
        or higher on the tests are more likely to do very well in college 
        introductory classes as AP testing and preparation provides a window 
        for students to look into the college experience. Grade and GPA 
        disparities between those who take AP classes and those who donâ€™t are 
        very visible in introductory college classes. These classes and tests 
        are very useful because of the preparation they provide to students and 
        the more in-depth curriculums that are required to be studied.
